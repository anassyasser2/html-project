<h2>  3 Powerful Examples Of Artificial Intelligence In Use Today: </h2>
<h2>1-Siri:
Everyone is familiar with Apple's personal assistant, Siri. She's the
friendly voice-activated computer that we interact with on a daily
basis. She helps us find information, gives us directions, addevents to our calendars, helps us send messages and so on. Siri is a
pseudo-intelligent digital personal assistant. She uses machine-learning technology to get smarter and better able to predict and
understand our natural-language questions and requests.</h2>
<h2>2-Alexa: 
Alexa's rise to become the smart home's hub, has been somewhat meteoric. When Amazon first introduced Alexa, it took much of
the world by storm. However, it's usefulness and its uncanny ability to decipher speech from anywhere in the room has made it
a revolutionary product that can help us scour the web for information, shop, schedule appointments, set alarms and a
million other things, but also help power our smart homes and be a conduit for those that might have limited mobility.</h2>
<h2>3-Tesla:
If you don't own a Tesla, you have no idea what you're missing. This is quite possibly one of the best cars ever made. Not only for
the fact that it's received so many accolades, but because of its predictive capabilities, self-driving features and sheer
technological "coolness." Anyone that's into technology and cars needs to own a Tesla, and these
vehicles are only getting smarter and smarter thanks to their over-the-air updates.</h2>
